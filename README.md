# Unity VR Educational Experience

## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to create an interactive, educational virtual reality experience crafted for children to explore and learn about the planets in our solar system. Developed with Unity and the XR toolkit, this project provides an immersive learning experience that culminates in a quiz to test the player's acquired knowledge.

## Features

- **Planetary Exploration**: Traverse through our solar system and interact with each planet to discover fascinating facts.
- **Educational Content**: Engage with informative content that encourages learning in a fun & interactive manner.
- **Knowledge Assessment**: A final quiz to test and reinforce the learning achieved throughout the exploration.
- **Accessible Interaction**: Designed with user-friendly controls to provide a seamless experience for young explorers.

## Scripts

The core logic of the game is encapsulated in various C# scripts that handle different aspects like planet interaction, quiz management, UI, and audio control. Here's a brief overview:

- `PlanetController`: Manages the interaction with planets using XR controllers.
- `QuizManager`: Handles the logic for generating and evaluating quiz questions.
- `QuestionsAndAnswers`: Data structure for holding the quiz questions and answers.
- `UIAndAudioController`: Manages the UI updates and audio playback based on player interaction.
- `PlanetInstantiator`: Controls the instantiation of planets and triggers the cutscene playback.
- `PlanetAnimate`: Applies animation effects to the planets.
- `Planet`: Holds information about a planet including its name, description, and associated audio.

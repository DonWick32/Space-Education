# VR Space Education

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Introducing space education to kids serves as a gateway to fostering curiosity and scientific interest. To make learning about planets a thrilling adventure, this project utilizes virtual reality, interactive apps, and hands-on activities to provide immersive experiences for children. Additionally, testing a studentâ€™s understanding of the planets is a crucial aspect addressed through VR.

### Design

#### Application Building
The application is crafted using Unity, employing C# scripting and the XR Interaction Toolkit. All 3D assets and sounds used in the project are freely available on the internet.

#### Scene Construction
- First-person player movement + hands (oculus-compliant HMD controller)
- Rigid Body components on all surfaces for realistic physics
- Area lights for spaceship interior visibility
- Wormhole particle physics for teleportation visualization

#### Script Creation
The core logic of the game is encapsulated in various C# scripts handling different aspects:
- `PlanetController`: Manages interaction with planets using XR controllers.
- `QuizManager`: Handles the generation and assessment of quiz questions.
- `QuestionsAndAnswers`: Serves as a data structure for storing quiz questions and answers.
- `UIAndAudioController`: Manages UI updates and audio playback based on player interactions.
- `PlanetInstantiator`: Controls planet instantiation and triggers cutscene playback.
- `PlanetAnimate`: Applies animation effects to enhance planet visual appeal.
- `Planet`: Holds information about a planet, including its name, description, and associated audio.

### Tools Used
- Unity / C# 2022.3.12 (Latest Long-Term Support Version)
- Unity XR Interaction Toolkit and XR Device Simulator
- Unity Shader Graph and Timeline
- Blender
- Git (Version Control System)
